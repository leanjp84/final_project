# Final Project

Ironhack Front-End Bootcamp 2022

## Description

We’re going to build a simple To-do app with Vue.js that allows users to create an account, record tasks, edit them and mark them as complete. The app will be linked to a database, where all the user and task data will be stored. The database that we’ll use for this project is Supabase. We’ll also be using Vite as a build tool to compile our code and provide a development server while we work.
